    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> <b>Please read the following directions carefully:</b></p>

    <p>In this experiment, you will see some images of plants. Each image has a payoff associated with it. Some plants have higher payoffs, while others have lower payoffs. Importantly, these payoffs are not random: they are determined by certain features of the plants.</p>

    <p>You will first have a chance to learn the payoffs associated with different image. Then you will have a chance to select several images, and you will be paid the rewards associated with each of them. As mentioned before, some features of the plants lead to higher rewards, while others lead to lower rewards. </p>

    <p> </p>Lastly, you will be asked several survey questions. </p>
